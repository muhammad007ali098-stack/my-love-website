      Hey ❤️ You know… sometimes I think about how crazy it is that we met on TikTok by pure chance 😅.<br><br>
      Then somehow, we ended up playing PUBG together 🎮 — and honestly, from that moment, it didn’t feel like “just a game” anymore.<br>
      It felt like destiny was slowly bringing us closer. 🌸<br><br>

      From PUBG to Instagram, and then to WhatsApp… step by step, you’ve become such an important part of my life. 💕<br>
      Now, I don’t just want to be someone you text or call…<br>
      I want to be someone who stays with you through every moment, every laugh, every tear — from now until my last breath. 🌹<br><br>

      You’re not just someone I met randomly… you’re my choice, my heart, my everything. ❤️

    <p class="subtitle">I love you forever and always ❤️</p>
