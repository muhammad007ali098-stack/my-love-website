    <h1 class="title">Hey ❤️

You know… sometimes I think about how crazy it is that we met on TikTok by pure chance 😅.
Then somehow, we ended up playing PUBG together 🎮 — and honestly, from that moment, it didn’t feel like “just a game” anymore.
It felt like destiny was slowly bringing us closer. 🌸

From PUBG to Instagram, and then to WhatsApp… step by step, you’ve become such an important part of my life. 💕
Now, I don’t just want to be someone you text or call…
I want to be someone who stays with you through every moment, every laugh, every tear — from now until my last breath. 🌹

You’re not just someone I met randomly… you’re my choice, my heart, my everything. ❤️</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">I love you forever and always ❤️</p>
